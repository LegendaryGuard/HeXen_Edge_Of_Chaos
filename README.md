heXen:Edge of Chaos will be a new and free game, based on the original Hexen franchise that was developed by id Software and Raven Software. The game utilizes the id Tech 4 GPL engine that id Software released on November 22, 2011. Previously the project was a total conversion for Doom 3.

Edge of Chaos is being developed by a team of fans who have always loved the original Hexen since it came out. In fact, most of us spent countless hours with the entire series. When id Software released Doom3, we immediately saw immense potential in the engine itself; the ‘Hell’ maps gave us the inspiration to make a hack-and-slash game based, primarily, on the original Hexen. Our story ties into the expansion packs and also touches upon the Heretic narrative; especially the incredible atmosphere painted into these rich worlds and their darkling journeys.

The game will be released in three episodes, each based on one character class. Our first demo release, an excerpt from the first episode, is based on the Cleric class. The second and third episodes will be based on the warrior and sorceress class respectively. We’ve chosen to use an episodic approach in order to create a manageable release schedule.

**HISTORY**

"I wonder what the Wraithverge would look like in the Doom 3 engine…" was the simple premise that launched this project back in 2004 by founder Bloodrayne. From there things just went on: people started e-mailing and before we knew it we were inquiring with Raven Software if we would be allowed to create this Total Conversion. In order to receive permission, we had to ensure that we used no original assets and could never receive any payment, in any way, for the game. Our personal requirement which we still adhere to today in each each and every asset put into the game is quality. One of our favourite development sayings has been: "Is it Hexeny enough?"

After two years of progressive development, the process became increasingly more difficult. Some mistakes were made in terms of planning, background information, map layouts. Fortunately, help came from an unexpected area in the form of new team members, some of which we still have today. The first thing we did was attract a professional writer and concept artist to help us expand on this wonderful world. The Journals of Roden, the foundational basis for our game today, were based on the initial ideas that we had brought to the mod.

At one point, bad tidings came again when we made the poor decision to switch engines. After being convinced ‘it was easy’ to switch to the Quake 4 engine (also the D3 engine) we tried to do so, but after having ported everything over the person that coded for us left without notice. From here, we were in the crazy position where nothing worked anymore; the project was derailed for 12 months. Nothing was going to stop us though! And with renewed vigour we attracted new members. Some of which, again, are still with us today.

Over time more members joined and more members left. We had planned almost since the beginning of moving to a standalone game based on the history of id Softare releasing their source code to previous engines. This focus to custom assets payed off when they followed their tradition and released the Doom 3 engine as GPL in 2011. We have since moved our development to a standalone environment and hope to bring our next release to everyone as soon as we can. Our founder, Bloodrayne, has since left the team in late 2011 after having a dimishing role starting in early 2010.

**THE STORY**

The story is expanded upon in our Journals of Roden. Please read them here, as they contain important information about the background of the game – The Journals of Roden

The story focuses on the brothers Paegus and Salius, the sons of Parias the Cleric from the original Hexen, who find themselves corrupted by misuse of the Wraithverge: a holy weapon meant to only slay the guilty.

**THE ALPHA RELEASE**

In November 2010 we released a playable Alpha of the mod. We’ve done this for two major reasons: to showcase to the gaming world where we stand and to attract more talented team members. We still need help with models, animations and maps. This Alpha comprises just one hub (three maps interconnected with each other) containing gameplay that’s comparable to the original Hexen.

**THE FUTURE**

We expect a lot of cool things to happen in the future, namely the next release of Hubs 1 and 2 as a standalone game.
